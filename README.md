# OCPP Task manager

A general purpose [OCPP](https://www.openchargealliance.org/) framework 
that can be used to build anything related to OCPP.

You can build software for a physical chargepoint or a virtual simulator,
you can also use it to build Backends or Charging Station Management Systems (CSMS).

It is transport layer agnostic, so that you have the full power to define
how the messages are sent and received.

Code examples coming soon...
